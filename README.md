# Change-Printer-Tray-Python
A simple python script that allows you to change your default paper source! I used a brother printer, but it should work on any printer!

Update, this code is kind of a giant mess. I have a few versions that I tested in the folders and programmed into the changeserver.py itself. This project is designed to work on windows and save files via scan to a file path defined by string. It can also change the printer tray that is currently being used. Both are designed to work with POST API calls. I was using a method that called a c# .exe file from subprocess using python, and it worked. The only issue was the formatting of everything it spit out. So ugly. I find that by using python to do it all has worked much better, and there is no need to mess with dpi, scale, nothin.. I have been saving the images with a .jpg extension and it works well, even though in the code it says its encoded as png. All together, not the most organized project, but I am sure that this code could be useful to somebody one day.
